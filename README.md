# Example Profile Page

- This is an example profile page just to test out HTML and CSS skills.
- The page consists of small containers that are all responsive to different screen sizes
- The icons are from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

This is a very basic page, and was great to practice some of my UX skills.
